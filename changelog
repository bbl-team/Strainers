All current upgrades are effected by these changes!

Specialized Upgrades added basically each of the upgradable part of the strainers (durations, input, output and meshes) have there own specialized upgrade
    Example: Mesh not taking any damage will increase duration by a amount. These have no recipes by default due to the high power level of the items!
